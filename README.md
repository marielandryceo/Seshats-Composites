# Seshats-Composites

**Seshats-Composites** is a project focused on the development and application of advanced composite materials derived from organic hemp oil and hemp-derived carbon allotropes. Our mission is to harness sustainable and renewable resources to create high-performance composite materials for a variety of industrial, engineering, and consumer applications.

## Overview

Seshat’s Composites leverage the unique properties of hemp oil and carbon allotropes (such as graphene, carbon nanotubes, and activated carbon) to create materials that are:

- **Sustainable & Eco-friendly:** Made from renewable hemp resources, reducing reliance on petrochemicals.
- **High-Performance:** Enhanced mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties due to the inclusion of advanced carbon materials.
- **Versatile:** Suitable for use in construction, automotive, aerospace, sporting goods, and more.

## Features

- **Biobased Matrix:** Uses organic hemp oil as the resin or matrix.
- **Carbon Reinforcement:** Incorporates various hemp-derived carbon allotropes for superior strength and conductivity.
- **Customizable Formulations:** Tailor properties for specific end-use requirements.
- **Environmentally Conscious:** Designed with end-of-life recyclability and biodegradability in mind.

## Applications

- Structural panels and beams
- Lightweight automotive and aerospace parts
- Sporting equipment
- Sustainable consumer goods
- Energy storage and electronic components
